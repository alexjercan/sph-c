# SPH Simulation IN WEB???

Yes, that is right. But it works really bad... obviously.

I used <https://github.com/tsoding/zozlib.js> to make this possible.

## Quickstart

First make sure you build the project and then you come here.

```console
./build.sh
python -m http.server -d ../dist 6969
# open the browser at localhost:6969
```
